# Overclocking (OC)
Overclocking is an umbrella term for feeding more energy into something to make it run faster. There are many types of overclock, each with different properties. Some machines can also subtick parallel when you overclock recipes faster than one tick. (Note that not all machines subtick)

## Regular Overclock (ROC)
When a machine tier is higher than the recipe tier it will overclock, normally this is a 2x speed boost while consuming 4x the power. This is applied per tier overclocked, so one tier higher is 2x speed, 4x EU/t, two tiers is 4x speed, 16x EU/t, etc.

## Perfect Overclock (POC)
For Perfect OC, instead of 2x speed for 4x EU/t, its 4x speed for 4x EU/t. Perfect overclock cannot be “achieved”*, a machine(Usually a multiblock) simply has it or not. Also, when machines overclock down to 1, 2, or 3 ticks, they do not overclock anymore*. Because minecraft can’t run recipes in between ticks, and overclocking from there would be “imperfect,” it can’t overclock any further.
*In the EBF/ABS/RHF, every 1800K above the recipe temp, one overclock becomes perfect.
*Some machines have subtick parallel, where overclocks are converted into parallel instead.

## Tier Overclock (TOC)
This is probably the most “attribute-esque” of the overclock types. Most multiblocks have the ability to accept 2 energy hatches. This allows it to run recipes of 1 tier higher than the tier of the hatches. So 2 LV hatches allow MV recipes, 2 MV hatches allow HV recipes, etc. This happens because each hatch is 2 amps, and 4 amps of one tier is equivalent to 1 amp of power at 1 tier higher. This only happens if the machine allows 2 energy hatches, so a 4a hatch is not sufficient to tier overclock. Multiblocks can only TOC once, the rest will be SOC.

## Speed Overclock (SOC)
SOC only really exists as a distinction from TOC. Putting a lone 4a or 16a hatch will allow it to overclock once (or twice for the 16a). But this overclocking doesnt let it run any higher tier recipes. It only runs them faster. How much it speeds up is dependent on if the overclock is ROC or POC. You can put a 16a and a 2a/4a/16a hatch on any multiblock that accepts two hatches to get 1 TOC and an additional SOC.

## Fusion Overclock (FOC)
That's right! Fusion has its own weird type of overclock for some reason. Increasing the tier or amperage of energy hatches doesn’t make it any faster, but upgrading the reactor does. Every reactor tier above its base tier is 2x speed for 2x energy consumption.
