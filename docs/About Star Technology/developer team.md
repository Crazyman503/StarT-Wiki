## stellaurora - Developer

Hi! I'm stellaurora and I'm a computer science student. I'm interested in systems & low level programming along with high level web development and graphics design. I'm a programming and open source enthusiast with a love for Linux. I enjoy reading novels in my spare time and listening to music from EDM to hip-hop.

## KillLaAqua - Developer

Hii... I'm KillLaAqua. Currently I am a University Student studying Management Information Systems and Accounting (I'm an outlier womp womp). I often do balancing and play games in my free-time like a weirdo. Because of this, for StarT, I lead a lot of the balancing and the Endgame of the pack in addition to leading the Hard Mode development team. Besides hyper fixating and spreading democracy in the rest of my "free" time I enjoy EDM music and going on hikes/backpacking.

## UltraPuPower1 - Developer

Hey there, I am UltraPuPower. I hope to study computer science at university soon. I like programming (what a surprise), reading and minecraft. I enjoy learning about anything related to science, and enjoy maths. If you have any questions, ask away in discord.

## Caerglad - Developer

Hi, I'm Caerglad and I'm working as a software developer. As of my hobbies I like to tinker with thigs varying from software to fixing stuff as accidentally broken porcelain or electronics. Besides that like trying new things: woodworking, building dioramas, growing exotic plants, astrophotography and chasing auroras when they appear.

## Azu - Artist

Heya! I'm Azu aka GabiMar, I'm a computer science student, a modding enthusiast and an ***artist*** according to handful of folk. I dabble in many forms of art (with questionable success), from graphics design to 3d modeling, pixel art, music and more! My music taste is an abhorrent cacophony of genres and eras. Just hoping to make something people will enjoy <3
